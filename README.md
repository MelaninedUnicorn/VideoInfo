# VideoInfo
***
Very basic Electron project where we can upload a video and view the information.


```
videoinfo
├─ .vscode
│  └─ extensions.json
├─ README.md
├─ index.html
├─ index.js
├─ package-lock.json
└─ package.json

```

## Installation (from code)
***
I genuinely don't know why you would install this but here's how to do it. 
```
$ git clone git@github.com/MelaninedUnicorn/VideoInfo.git
$ cd ../VideoInfo
$ npm install
$ npm run electron
```
